Assignment1
Part-1

Link for S3 bucket:http://my645.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com
The S3 bucket has index.html and error.html files.
First I created a S3 bucket using the instructions given and uploaded index.html and error.html files. error.html file is for when index.html is not available, it gives an error page.
If you click on index.html you can view a restaurant page Yummy where u can find the StudentSurvey option on top click on it it will redirect to the "Click here for student Survey" link, when we click on it Survey form is available.


Part-2:

In part-2, I created a survey form i.e. survey.html,style.css.I have installed Eclipse and created a war file called assign1.war. Using the Tomcat server I have deployed it.

Link for ec2 instance:http://ec2-54-226-126-17.compute-1.amazonaws.com/Assign1/
Using this link we can access the form.

Final output when you open my index.html file it redirects to the page "YUMMY" where you can find the student survey form.
